# C
 This repo contains all the new programs I'll be creating in C with the
 help of book *The C Programming Language* written by **K&R**.
 I'll be scripting down my experience with the book as well as the 
 programs in it.

 The programs are compiled using `make` and executables can be found 
 in `.gitignore` dir.
